# Olist — Revenue & Customer Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This project analyzes e-commerce performance using SQL and Power BI, with a focus on understanding customer behavior, revenue distribution, and growth drivers.

The goal was to identify **what drives revenue**, **where it is concentrated**, and **how customer purchasing patterns impact overall business performance**.

---

## Tools Used

* SQL (PostgreSQL / DBeaver)
* Power BI (Data modeling & visualization)
* DAX (calculated measures and KPIs)

---

## Data Preparation

* Joined multiple datasets (customers, orders, order_items, payments) to create a unified analytical model
* Filtered to **delivered orders only** to ensure accurate revenue reporting
* Aggregated payment data at the order level to avoid duplication
* Created structured views for:

  * Customer revenue
  * Product performance
  * Yearly revenue trends

---
## Technical Highlights

- Built multi-table joins across customers, orders, and payments to create a unified analytical dataset  
- Prevented revenue duplication by aggregating payment data at the order level  
- Filtered to delivered orders to ensure accurate revenue reporting  
- Created DAX measures for KPIs and dynamic dashboard interactivity

## Key Insights

### Customer Behavior

* Repeat customers represent ~3% of customers but generate ~5.6% of total revenue
* Suggests opportunity for retention strategies and loyalty programs

### Geographic Revenue Distribution

* Revenue is highly concentrated in São Paulo (~37% of total revenue)
* Highlights regional dependency and potential geographic risk
* Opportunity to expand into underperforming regions

### Revenue Trends

* Revenue growth is primarily driven by increased order volume
* Average revenue per order remains relatively stable
* Suggests growth is coming from acquisition rather than increased customer spend
  
---
## Business Recommendations

- Invest in retention strategies to increase repeat customer contribution  
- Expand operations and marketing in underrepresented regions to reduce geographic concentration risk  
- Explore pricing or bundling strategies to increase average order value
